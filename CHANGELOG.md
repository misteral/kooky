# Changelog

Notable changes per release. Tagged commits use `vX.Y.Z` shortform.

## v0.11.10 — 2026-05-21

- Fixed: arrow keys, Home, and End now navigate correctly inside ncurses TUIs (mc, dialog, …). The pinned `xterm-256color` terminfo declares cursor keys in SS3 form (`kcuu1=\EOA`, `khome=\EOH`, `kend=\EOF`), which ncurses matches strictly after the app calls `smkx` (application cursor mode); kooky was emitting only the CSI form (`\e[A`), so the bytes leaked through as literal characters and mc's panels refused to scroll. Unmodified arrows + Home/End now send SS3 form, modified variants keep the CSI-with-mod-digit shape. Shells / readline / zle / vim / nvim bind both forms to the same action, so interactive prompts see no change.

## v0.11.8 — 2026-05-19

- Fixed: switching back to a tab or workspace whose pane had been printing output in the background no longer leaves the buffer "creeping upward" — the cursor row is correctly pinned to the bottom on re-attach. AppKit detaches the surface view when a tab/workspace is swapped out, and any output streamed in while it was off-screen left libghostty's viewport anchored above the cursor. On re-attach AppKit skips `setFrameSize` when the frame is unchanged, so the existing size-driven re-anchor in `propagateSizeToSurface` didn't fire. `viewDidMoveToWindow` now invokes libghostty's `scroll_to_bottom` binding action explicitly on the no-frame-change re-attach path, mirroring the same-name guard already used in the size path. First-mount is excluded — the empty surface has nothing to anchor.

## v0.11.7 — 2026-05-19

- Imported upstream fixes from iAmCorey/kooky `v0.11.4..v0.11.6`:
  - Fixed: Chinese / Japanese / Korean IME candidate window now appears right under the cursor instead of flying out of the window to the bottom-left of the screen. Pinyin, kana, hangul compose inline like in every other macOS app.
  - Fixed: long CJK inputs no longer leave a phantom space mid-line; when the input wraps to a second line, the first line no longer disappears.
  - Fixed: shell history and Tab completion now survive kooky restarts.
  - Fixed: environment variables in `~/.zshenv`, `~/.zprofile`, `~/.bash_profile` now load in kooky terminals.

## v0.11.6 — 2026-05-19

- Fixed: ⌘V (paste) and ⌘C (copy) now fire on non-Latin keyboard layouts — Russian, Greek, Dvorak, AZERTY, anything where the physical V/C keys produce different characters. The pane's `keyDown` used to match by `event.charactersIgnoringModifiers`, which despite the name still reflects the active keyboard layout: on a Russian layout that key produces «м», so the comparison against `"v"` silently no-op'd and the paste branch was skipped. Switched to physical keyCode matching (`kVK_ANSI_V` = 9, `kVK_ANSI_C` = 8), same pattern already used a few lines below for ⌘← / ⌘→ / ⌘⌫. Layout-independent by construction.

## v0.11.5 — 2026-05-19

- Fixed properly: agents launched from the `+` menu under Powerlevel10k's *instant prompt* feature no longer fail with `Input must be provided either through stdin or as a prompt argument when using --print`. v0.11.4 attempted this via a `precmd` hook, but p10k's main `_p9k_precmd` (the one that actually restores stdio) appends itself to `precmd_functions` lazily and ends up AFTER any hook the kooky wrapper rc registered — so the agent still inherited captured stdio. Switched zsh's launch path to a `zle-line-init` widget (via `add-zle-hook-widget`), which fires once the entire precmd chain is done and zle is ready to read input. Setting `BUFFER` + `zle accept-line` submits the launch command as if the user typed it, so the agent runs as a real foreground command with TTY stdio and proper OSC 133 preexec/postexec bracketing. bash continues to use `PROMPT_COMMAND` (no p10k-equivalent for bash to step on us).

## v0.11.4 — 2026-05-19

- Fixed: agents launched from the `+` menu (Claude Code, Codex, …) no longer fail with `Input must be provided either through stdin or as a prompt argument when using --print` when the user's `~/.zshrc` enables Powerlevel10k's *instant prompt* feature. The wrapper rc used to run `eval "$KOOKY_AGENT"` inline while parsing zshrc — but p10k redirects stdout/stderr into a capture buffer until the first prompt renders, so the agent inherited non-TTY stdio, silently switched into non-interactive mode, then errored because no input was piped. Launch is now deferred to a one-shot `precmd` hook (zsh) / `PROMPT_COMMAND` entry (bash) that fires only after p10k restores stdio. Plain (non-p10k) users see no behavioral change. *(Note: this fix was incomplete — see v0.11.5.)*

## v0.11.3 — 2026-05-16

- Drag a file or folder from Finder onto any kooky terminal pane → its path drops in at the cursor. Multi-file drag = space-separated paths.

## v0.11.1 — 2026-05-15

- Fixed: right-clicking inside an inactive split now activates that pane first.

## v0.11.0 — 2026-05-15
